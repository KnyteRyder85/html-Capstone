        <p>I have been playing Fantasy Football for over 13 years.  Football is my favorite sport to watch because it what I was raised on.  I started playing in free leagues to see how it all worked out.  Once I got the hang of it, I started playing in money leagues.  Playing fantasy football requires a lot of research and knowledge of skill players.  Although it can become extremely stressful when drafting your team, it gets you more involved with the other games.  I keep track of stats and injuries.</p>

        <p>Other than playing football on recess with my friends during my childhood, I wasn't into physical fitness.  I did take weight training in high school, but I wasn't too serious about it.  It wasn't until my mid-30s when I became fully invested into this hobby.  I believe that if you think you are old, you age really quick.  If you believe you are young, you age slowly.  When I talk about these beliefs, I'm referring to your external features because no matter how young you look, your bones and muscles still age and become brittle.  That's why it's important to stay fit, so you can strengthen your muscles and bones as you progress through life.</p>

        <p>I have always been a Playstation fan.  I like the Playstation better when it comes to gaming because the graphics and games just seem better.  My favorite games to play on my free time are any of the Resident Evil games, Madden, and any game that has a compelling story.  I'm more of a campaign player.  I rarely play multi-player games.</p>
